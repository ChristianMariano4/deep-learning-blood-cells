# 🩸 Blood Cell Classification

## 📚 University Project - Polytechnic of Milan  
This project was developed as part of a university course at the **Polytechnic of Milan** by our team, **Four Neurons**. The goal was to create an **accurate deep learning model** that classifies blood cell images into one of **eight classes**, each representing a different cell type.

## 👥 Team - "Four Neurons"
We are a team of four students passionate about deep learning and computer vision. This project allowed us to apply our knowledge in **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and fine-tuning state-of-the-art architectures.
